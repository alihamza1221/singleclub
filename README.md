[4. Keep in sync always♻️ (best practice🤝🏻) ](https://github.com/alihamza1221/quickMeet/edit/master/README.md#4-keep-in-sync-always%EF%B8%8F-best-practice)<br>

[6. Installing packages required 📦📥](https://github.com/alihamza1221/quickMeet#6-installing-packages-required-)<br>

### 1. Fork the project 🔪

   [Fork Button](https://github.com/alihamza1221/quickMeet)

### 2. Clone the forked repository 📥

  You need to clone (download) it to your local machine using below command in terminal
```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/quickMeet.git
```
> This makes a local copy of the repository in your machine 📂

  Once you have cloned the `Quick-Meet-SDK` repository in Github, move➡️ to that folder first using the change directory `cd` command on Linux/ Mac/ Windows
```bash
   $ cd Quick-Meet-SDK
```

### 3. Let us Setup 🔧⚙️
Run the following commands to verify that your _local copy_ has a reference to your _forked remote repository_ on Github
```bash
   $ git remote -v
```
It should display the below output
```
  origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/quickMeet.git (fetch)
  origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/quickMeet.git (push)
```

Now, let us add the reference to the original `quickMeet` repository using the below command 🔙
```bash
  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/quickMeet/quickMeet.git
```
> The above command creates a new remote as `upstream`

To Verify the changes run the below command
```bash
  $ git remote -v
```
Output in console ☑️:
```
  origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/quickMeet.git (fetch)
  origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/quickMeet.git (push)
  upstream  https://github.com/alihamza1221/quickMeet.git (fetch)
  upstream  https://github.com/alihamza1221/quickMeet.git (push)
```

### 4. Keep in sync always♻️ (best practice🤝🏻) 
It is a better practice to keep the `local copy` in sync with the `original repository` and to stay updated with the latest changes. Run the below commands before making changes or in regular intervals to stay updated with the `base` branch

```
  # Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
  $ git fetch --all --prune

  # Switch to the master branch
  $ git checkout master

  # Reset the local master branch to match the upstream repository's master branch
  $ git reset --hard upstream/master

  # Push changes to your forked quickMeet repo
  $ git push origin master
```

### 5. Ready for the contribution 🌝
Once you are done with the above steps, you are ready to contribute to the `QuickMeet` project code. Check out the `issues` tab of the `original repository` and solve them. Once you are done with your changes, submit your efforts with a `pull request`

## Hold on! Instructions are not done yet 🌚

### 6. Installing packages required 📦📥

```bash
   npm install
```
